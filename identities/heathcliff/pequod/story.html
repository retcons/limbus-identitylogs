      <h1>The Pequod Harpooneer</h1>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>The child held a dagger, sharp as a razor.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>His hands were trembling. Beads of sweat rolled down his forehead as he fixed his eyes upon the tip of the dagger.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>The child bit down on a thick piece of rope in his mouth. He brought the dagger close to his forearm. And cut.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>A pained weeping. A quiet wailing. Something in between. The rope could not contain such sounds from escaping the child's mouth. But his knife-arm continued to cut.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>The child began cutting faster. And faster.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Flesh splitting with every gash hewn by the dagger. Lifting his tattooed flesh off his skin little by little.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Because the brand of the Middle must be removed.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Is there really no place in the City that could remove his tattoos? Of course there are.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>No matter how special the Middle's tattoos are compared to other augmentation tattoos, there has to be a solution somewhere in the City.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>But that wasn't how this child wanted to remove his tattoos.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Regret for the choices he's made. Shame of his past. Brand of his alignment.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>There once was a woman whom he loved dearly. With her words she broke his heart. Wrath and jealousy drove him to wander until he somehow found his way into the Middle.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>But no matter how much time he spent as a part of the Middle... there was no going back like this.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>All of that... had to be removed by his own hands. And that's the only way he could be free from them. So that he can stand proud before the one he loves when he returns.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>That is what the child thought. That is why this child continues to mutilate himself.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Perhaps the child boarded this ship in hopes that, in the far Lakes, they would not be able to pursue him.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>... The child killed many things as he toiled as the Pequod's Harpooneer.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>He killed Mermaids to turn their flesh into jerky. He killed Pirates that got in the way. He even hunted Whales.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>He was the Captain's harpoon, always striking where the Captain ordered the child to strike.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Killing wasn't anything new or difficult for the child.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>The child's ended countless lives with his own hands when he was a part of the Middle.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>But... things have changed since then.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Back then, he killed by choice.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Now... he no longer trusts himself. So he kills under the Captain's orders instead.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>He clearly recalled what the Captain declared.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>'Once this voyage is over... everything will come to be.'</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>The future the child wanted. The path that this child truly wished to go in. An old love he so dearly wanted to meet again.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>The child believed that once this voyage is over... they will all return.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Thus, he continues to tear his own flesh. Thus, he continues to pierce the Whales with his harpoon.</span>
