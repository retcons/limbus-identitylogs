        <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Haah... I've got a splitting headache.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>No, no. Literally. I think my skull's actually about to split in half and blast off.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>I don't get it. I don't understand how anyone, like them writers, makes a living doing this torture every bloody day.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>It's just intuition, dammit. My sources? How about my gut feeling, huh? How am I supposed to explain that?</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>I've examined hundreds of scenes since I started working here. I've been working here for a good while, too...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>And before this... I've seen enough of the rough and tumble and had more than my share of violence.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>After a life like that... the hows and whys of a murder scene just come naturally to me. It's just intuition, nothing more.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>But I'm not like the armchair detectives in those mystery novels. It's not like I can figure out the whole scene and scheme from a glance. Sometimes clues get lost in the whole mess, and... Gah, my head...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Calling me a 'profiler', whatever that means... Forcing me to write these reports every damn day... I'm about to lose it.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>I'm not thinking of quitting, though.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>I do love catching these smart—arses off guard. Watching their overcomplicated conspiracies blowing up in their faces because some poor, uneducated sod like me caught them with their britches down... Priceless.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Besides, getting to meet them face—to—face like this before caving their skulls in? Downright therapeutic.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>They always wear this stupid look on their faces, like it didn't occur to them once that we'd find out. It's all quite entertaining.</span>
