              <span>Yeah. What kind of explanation is that, boss? That's like if we were in an art class and you asked us to draw a whole owl from two circles.</span>

          <span>The child made a peculiar expression as he rubbed his chin.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>He was probably starting to wonder if his instructions weren't getting through to the junior sailors.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>He was hoping that, with these training exercises, he could train the sailors to be stronger. So that more of them would survive when facing the inevitable Waves...</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>... but it was no easy task.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Facing the Waves, challenging the Whales... always resulted in losses.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Lucky sailors met a swift death or were swept away to the sea by the Waves.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Some unlucky, wounded sailors survived the encounters with the Whales. This meant that they had to watch as their own bodies and minds were slowly overwritten by that of the Mermaids.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>"... Lower the skiff."</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>The Captain often ordered the child to lower the skiff.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>And the child knew exactly why. On the Pequod, no one was allowed to die. Not without the Captain's explicit orders.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>But there had to be some other explanation for their disappearances, and that was what the skiff was for.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>The child used to protest the Captain's orders.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>"We could have at least tried to save them."
    "Why did the ship have to sail directly into the Waves? Why now?"</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>... But now, the child knew.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>The first mate still answers directly to the Captain. And the Captain could not be defied.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>That's why the child let the sailors play their silly pranks on him.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>That's why the child spent so much time trying to teach the junior sailors how to fight with these training sessions.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>But watching them disappear one by one from the ship made the child realize something.
    That in the end, nothing he did mattered.</span>

          <span>And the most he could do to speed the voyage on even a little bit... was to obey the Captain of the Pequod without question.</span>
