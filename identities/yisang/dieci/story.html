      <h1>Dieci South Section 4</h1>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>It is paramount in the mastery of the fist that I remain fully aware of the structure of the human anatomy.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Sparring, basic cardiovascular fitness training, striking at punching bags... The ways of improving one's body are truly numerous. However...</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>... one must spend a significant amount of time before a desk, pen in hand, to truly grasp what constitutes the mastery of the fist.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Have you ever experienced fatigue so extreme that each step feels as though you are wading through a quaggy mire? Yet, in that exhaustion, my mind is cleared like the reflective surface of a freshly minted coin.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>I grow rather joyous on such occasions. To gaze upon the blueprint of a human body in solitude is to train my brain as one does body, to fortify the threads of my mind as one does the threads of musculature.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>I imagine the human anatomy in equivalence to an architecture.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>In the Association library's knowledge repository, those countless bundles of paper, I have found most interesting the subject of architecture.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Considering that the young child lifted from a terrible fate by the Association found the sections under 'Architecture' and 'Human Anatomy' most interesting as he perused from 'A' row to 'H' row of the Library...</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>... it would be no hyperbole to say that these two subjects have much in common.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Shear wall structure. Trusses design. Flat-slab construction.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>I soon came to understand that, as I took notes on these words too electrifying to even vocalize, each and every one of these techniques was an outcome of an extended meditation on the pursuit of utmost stability.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>However, after a long contemplation of such designs, I have also come to understand that even the most robust of architectures have load-bearing walls that will crumble the entire construction should they be properly damaged.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>I find the study of such vulnerabilities quite intriguing.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>If one were to ask me whyever, then I may answer that such study permits one to demolish and reconstruct defective construction with a newly invented structure closer to perfection, to tear down the architecture with ease once its flaws have been identified and eliminated.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Such ideation came to me in the wake of my adulthood, as I began undertaking tasks for the Association. It was around that time when I reached the 'H' section of the library.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>I began to muse that perhaps flawed structures are ambling about in the name of 'human anatomy'.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>I had a sudden thought that I wished to correct these flaws. Not only by the Association's orders, but compelled by my nature as a researcher.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Indeed, the human anatomy, though it may initially appear rather consistent across every individual, transfigurates into different 'structures' as the body grows.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Certain structures grow to be increasingly unstable in their physical blueprints, yet are reinforced by the cement and steel frame of a powerful mind that allows them to stand steadfast...</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>... whereas certain other structures have firm physical balance yet have built themselves an incredibly flawed internal design.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>The more flawed a structure is, the more obvious their vulnerabilities become.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>With my research, I may demolish them with a mighty and precise strike so that they may be rebuilt to a proper shape.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Thus completed is the mastery of the fist.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>The mastery of an art that, instead of the polymorphous fickleness of the Keys that unnecessarily destroys the outer layer, strikes at the core of the structure.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Indubitably, that is why I, a structure myself, have selected these fists as my passion.</span>
