        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>The iron horse rumbles onward. The air is heavy inside the locomotive.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Voiceless ones ride the iron horse. Have we lost our tongues? Nay, we are but lonesome souls. Companionship is a comfort seldom sought, scarcely expected here, whether that be with the ones adjacent to or with ones opposite of.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>They appear to lack even the strength to will their lips into speech.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Shoulders slumped, necks hung, vacant eyes gazing into or fingers tapping at the small tools in their hands.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>No different from them, I am.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>In this iron horse I sit still, voiceless and unfocused; its will is entirely detached from my own. With aimless eyes I look at naught in particular; no person, no object comes into focus.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>How long has it been since I was last given reprieve from labor?</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>To measure it is meaningless. To attempt it is an act of futility.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>My employers are quite adept at pilfering time and memories.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Though it is said that a janitor uses their services not, I know not if I hallucinate or merely recollect in imagining my very own torn body as I pull the passengers' shredded corpus together.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Perhaps I have unknowingly done labor of many lifetimes. There is a fraction of truth to that notionâ€”my exhaustion alone a testimonial to its veracity.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Yet, what worth does that truth hold, if any?</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>... The existence of this iron horse is no different from that of mine.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>My own feet betray me. My own arms do not steer my comings and goings. My path is a track laid by the herd.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>I who, even with immeasurable fatigue laden upon my back, commute to work and commute to home as the sun rises and sets.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>I who, as I rebuild the passengers' corpus, pay nary a mind to who they were, why they elected to jaunt via this infernal train. The iron horse cares not about the doings of others. It merely comes and goes as it is told.
    ... Just as I do.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>The distinction blurs.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>I muse. Is the existence of this iron horse the very selfsame as that train that which I abominate so?</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>My senses suddenly become fully aware. My palms reach to the dagger worn on my waist. I may have been unwittingly made a passenger on that train. And I would have no way of knowing. Then...</span>

        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>The iron horse comes to a halt. People exit and board. I exhale.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Nightmarish reveries must have taken hold of me once again. Terror sinks deep and lands heavily upon my laden heart.</span>

        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>I...</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>I push the company cap down over my eyes and rise. Work draws nigh.</span>

        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>I have no recourse.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>For half of today I am charged with educating our new fellow employees. It will be a fleeting moment of respite from cleaving and collecting the remains of our slain passengers.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>An insignificant consolation, yet relief is relief. I leave the iron horse behind and make my way to the trains.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>A wry and worthless grin passes my face, knowing there is no place for a self on this path I walk.</span>
