      <h1>Lobotomy E.G.O::Magic Bullet</h1>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>'An ordeal is coming.'</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>The child scoffed lightly despite the Marksman's serious declaration.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Ordeals were merely an expected part of life in this place. Such an ominous warning was nothing but pointless dramatization.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Seemingly recognizing the child's nonchalant response, the entity continued.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>'No. This will be an ordeal far beyond your capabilities.'</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Words were unnecessary. The child could see exactly what the entity was talking about as though she was living through it.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>'It all begins in this hallway. It devours the fears and horrors that flee. It scours for the veiled guilt hiding in the deep corners of this place. And it continues to search for more sacrifices to be embraced.'</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>'When you are left all by your lonesome, after the trumpets of the apocalypse roar... you have no choice but to put that miserable bullet in your own temple.'</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>The child remained wordless, puffs of smoke from the pipe her only response. It hurt her throat and eyes... but she enjoyed watching the plume fade inches away from the abyss.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>There once was a time when she never even thought of bringing a thing like the smoking pipe anywhere near her mouth.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>'Unless you are to enter into a contract with me, that is...'</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>The following events played out before the child's eyes.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>The bullet pierces through everyone, everything that dares to stand in her way. Their skulls shatter to a thousand pieces.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>That single, indiscriminate bullet.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>And in that scene of destructive pandemonium... the child feels...</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>... the same feeling she felt when she took the first drag of the smoking pipe.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>She also came to a certain understanding.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>That what the entity offered her was not the bullet that never misses. It offered her a bullet that will never stop until it strikes the one its user loves the most.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Yet, the child...</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>'Fine. I accept your contract.'</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>'You already have.'</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>'You did the moment you saw what played out before your eyes.'</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>As the Marksman finished his sentence, the child suddenly realized that she was ready to fire the bullet at any moment.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>'Oh, how I look forward to that very day.'</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>'To see what choice you'd make after putting that bullet into the skull of the one you love most.'</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>'You must know that I may very well be your future.'</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>She still availed the entity nothing but a brief scoff.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>'Hmph, is that what you think?'</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>'â€¦!'</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Thus the final destination of the bullet was revealed.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>The child had nothing left but her singular goal.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>That she would survive these ordeals and return home, no matter what.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>She would give anything if she could return. Even the cruelest of clauses would be mercy and a blessing.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>The bullet will pierce everyone, everything that stands in her way. In the end, it will return with her to her home.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>It will fly past all those that the child loved, even those that she loved when she could not...</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>... and eventually...</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>'I see... If it means the trajectory of this contract will be altered, you are willing to deceive anyone.'</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>'Precisely. Even myself, if I must.'</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>... fly toward her own skull.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>And in her final moment... the child will go out wearing that same, confident grin.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Has she deceived even herself for her singular goal? ... Or is that merely an expression of her true feelings, appearing moments before the end?</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Alas, the answers will never be known. But that is how this contract will end.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="dlg narrate">
          <span>Because the child will gladly meet the altered trajectory of her own making.</span>
