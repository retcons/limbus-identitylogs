              <div class="dlg_line">
                <span>... Though if I'm going to take care of this job she gave me... I suppose it would be best that I don't leave any unfinished contracts behind.</span>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>The child sighed and scribbled something on a small notepad...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>... And made her way back to the Office.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>The note said [Open Contract 4/4].</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>And above it were several other entries labeled "Private Contracts".</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>The child's relatively small Fixer Office was flooded with a decent amount of daily contracts. To the point where it rivaled the workload of some Associations' lower ranking Sections.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg">
            <img src="/assets/icons/Outis.png" />
            <div>
              <div class="dlg_teller">
                <span class="dlg_name">Outis</span>
                <span class="dlg_title">(Molar Office)</span>
              </div>
              <div class="dlg_line">
                <span>Huhh... What am I even doing? This busyness isn't at all what I wanted when I started my own Fixer Office...</span>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>While Offices and Associations are both Fixer organizations, the minutiae of their workings were somewhat different.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>It's not entirely correct to say that Associations are naturally superior to Offices, though they employ many more Fixers and operate on a larger scale. This is why many offices maintain an Associate relationship with the Associations.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Many assume that Offices' primary source of income is from private contracts. But even that isn't easy to snag when the Office hasn't made a name for itself yet.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>So fledgling Offices often take what are known as "Open Contracts".</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Associations often take and post Open Contracts so Fixer Offices can pick them up. But since they are also taken on a first—come, first—serve basis, many offices often go days without grabbing a single one of them.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Associate Offices or Offices with an Association insider may be subcontracted by them, but neither has been true for this child.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>When the child opened her own Office, she dreamed of slow, easy days of low—effort contracts and nights full of delicious liquor.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Did she manage to pick up an Open Contract? Time to get to work. Did she not? Time to get plastered.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>... That was the plan, anyway. After a while of doing exactly that, her Office's reputation inadvertently grew, and Private Contracts enough to form a queue began drizzling in. It had grown to be a rather reputable Office.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>But this contract was...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Something on a completely different level of significance.</span>

              <div class="dlg_line">
                <span>Ha ha... I don't know if I should thank my friend for this fortune or blame her for getting me into this mess.</span>

                <span>A contract from a Wing... Even I can't help but feel a bit anxious about it.</span>

          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>This contract had somehow found its way into her Office all the way from R Corp., one of the City's Wings.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Of course, it was only sheer luck that the child's friend was the first to bring up this contract... to which the child eagerly and immediately jumped at...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>But luck favors those who are prepared to seize it, after all. It may simply be a testament to how much her Office had grown.</span>
