        <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>So, what do you think?</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>I get to visit a museum, an exhibition featuring brand-new pieces of art every single day. All that for a bit of physical labor.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>No, no. I'm not expecting an answer. I don't think anyone else would care to look at this writing, either.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Consider this... a complex, unsimplifiable art critique, after a visit to a gallery.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>There wasn't anything special that drew me to join this company. I didn't find it very exciting, either.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>When I was offered this Cleanup Agent job, I considered it no different from my usual contracts, except that I'll be guaranteed a fixed income.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>I thought 'of course, a corporation of this size, a Wing at that, must have stuff to "clean up" here and there'.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>I didn't care about what they did, as long as they didn't annoy me. So I signed the contract.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>So imagine my surprise...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>When this train that people take without giving it a second thought, every single day...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Turned out to be a gallery of arts, sculpted with chisels of time!</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>While I was impressed with how well they were hiding this truth from the public... three words came to mind.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>This. Is. It.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>In hindsight, I was so absorbed with chasing after and creating my own "art"...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>...That I neglected to appreciate the "art" of others.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>A shameful realization. Appreciating others' art expands and deepens your understanding of this act of creation, regardless of its genre.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>That was why my recent work had been plagued with vapidity and regurgitation.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>No genuine, vivid imagination comes forth without a touch of reality.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>I saw one that used its soft tissues to conjoin two train cars, becoming a new 'door' between them...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>One that wrapped its flesh around the plush side of the seat, embodying a new chair with extra cushioning...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>One that is an amalgam of many, taking the shape of a new organism and lurching on... Though I wouldn't classify that as 'art'. Not yet.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>It doesn't qualify even as a performance art, as there was no intent to create the 'art' behind it.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Shambling without intent is... in the end, insufficient to be called art. It is incomplete at best.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>I butcher them. Because the company ordered me to make them easier to clean up.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>To interfere with the process of involuntary art isn't to my liking, no... But that doesn't happen very often. Besides, there is plenty to be gained from the rest.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>I enjoyed the company issued gear, too.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Void Curseblade. Refraction Demonblade. Dimensional Art Knife... I had many ideas for the name of this blade, but I eventually landed on Dimensional Demon Edge.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>I particularly enjoyed the part where it drained me when I cut down an incomplete art without proper preparation.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Indeed, dealing with works of art without appropriate mindfulness is itself an act of self-destruction.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Haah... I would have loved to keep doing that kind of work...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>I would have even foregone sleep to do so.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Shit... What are the higherâ€”ups thinking? It's ludicrous, making me babysit these rookies...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Hmph, look at that guy over there, blabbering on and on. Maybe he enjoys this kind of humdrum work.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>What an oddity. How does he find this interesting in any capacity when solid gold rolls into the station every single day?</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>If he likes B.S. that much, he might as well do this whole drivel himself...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Hah, as if they'd let that happen.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Damn it, even at this very moment I'm missing out...</span>
