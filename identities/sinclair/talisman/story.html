      <h1>Lobotomy E.G.O::Red Sheet</h1>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>A murmur faintly echoes in the room.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>As candlelights waver, so does the writing brush in the child's hand, imbued with red ink.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>The child ceaselessly writes red letters on yellow talismans.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>He's writing down complicated spells of wishes and curses targeted at somebodies.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Could the child have learned this art of thaumaturgy?</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Probably not.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Then, was it the group the child belongs to... the 'technology liberation alliance' that taught him how to make talismans?</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>That wouldn't be the case, either.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Perhaps he's making sheets of paper containing tremendous technology, aiding his group's terrorist attacks?</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>No, that simply couldn't be.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>What the child did was simply fight a few fights wearing the E.G.O his group borrowed from the underground levels of an L Corp. facility.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>However, the child does seem immersed in this craft of talismans and dark arts.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Rather than putting on E.G.O and using it as a tool...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>It was as though he became one with the E.G.O...or the Abnormality itself, putting the things in its mind to action as if possessed.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>That's right. Most E.G.O will try to encroach on its user and corrode them.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>It's said that uttering someone else's words as if they're your own and copying whatever they do eventually makes you no different from that person, right?</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Then it may only be natural that using someone else's mind like a tool gradually assimilates yours into it.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Forgetting your self...as if it has taken it.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>It would be wise to have someone else take the child's E.G.O off before it corrodes him further, but it doesn't look like the organization he belongs to will be eager to do so considering the excellent compatibility and results he's been showing.</span>
