      <h1>R Corp. 4th Pack Rhino</h1>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>It was hell.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Although the arena was large and the sky was above.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>The stench of blood and dust suffused my lungs to their brim, while heavy and frequent breathing put me in a haze.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>A hellish place filled with the sounds of boots dragging across the ground, fists striking guts, sides, faces, chests, wherever there was flesh.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>And countless me, I, and more of myself.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>They called this place the Hatchery.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Everyone must survive the Hatchery if they are to be deployed as R Corp's combatants.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Within it are innumerable clones of myself. Like vermin shoved alive and crawling in a cage too small, we battle one another for survival.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Maximize efficient acquisition of combat experience, and select the most exceptional specimen.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Thus, it matters not who the original was.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>'I' am whichever copy manages to survive.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>After that selection process, I was hatched.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>I underwent a special procedure so that my bioelectric signals could operate a massive exoskeletal suit, for which I was fitted afterward.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Surviving the Hatchery did not mean the end of the struggle, however.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>The colossal suit continued to drain my life energy.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>The bioelectric induction procedure simply referred to the process in which my energy was made to be transferrable to the suit, which was something that my assigned team accepted readily.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>It was unpleasant. My comrades and I suffered constant fatigue by our suits.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>We all used our personal funds to fill ourselves with caffeine and sugar, perhaps because we were all in agreement that having to take money out of our own wallets was better than returning to the hell that was the Hatchery.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Were I not to meet our expected combat performance goals, I would be dragged back to the Hatchery...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>And I'd fight an endless battle against me and more of myself.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>It's the same reason I remain loyal to this hardened wristblade, unlike my comrades who forge on with bulkier weaponry.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Because... this was what kept me alive in there.</span>
          </div>
