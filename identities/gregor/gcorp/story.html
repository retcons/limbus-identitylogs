            <span>The child slammed on and on.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>He could’ve been hacking away.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Or perhaps he was stabbing.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>A medal emblematizing his rank rested at a corner of his chest, as if to acknowledge the troubles he went through.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>The child’s eyes, ones which once shone with a vigorous gleam, have now been drained of any color.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Was there any meaning to that war?</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>The conflict of interests between multiple Wings? Perhaps, but were the interests of the many children who fought the war part of them?</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>It certainly would be nice if they were…</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Because, for this child, there’s no desire or wish of any kind on his face as he skewers the hearts of one enemy after another.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>The child used to salute with pure passion in his eyes only a short time ago, but that span wasn’t so short in his memory.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>And, his tired and battered mind…</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Eventually settled on the conclusion that stifling his emotions amidst bloodshed was the right way to be, or so it would seem.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Alright.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>If that is for your sake…</span>
          </div>
          <div class="dlg narrate">
            <span>Then, in its own way, it’s the right thing to do.</span>
